This project helps us to track the weather in different city around the world using OpenWeatherMap API and help us to narrow down our data to find out the city with out ideal weather condition. With this analysis we can make decision to travel where there is best weather condition. 

This analysis has been performed in Jupyter lab using different python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, hvplot,  etc, inorder to manipulate data and show them visually. Here are there are 2 main code, weatherPy and VacationPy. WeatherPy help us to find the ideal weather for us to choose the destination. and VacationPy helps us to by returning back the hotes within 10000 meter of the ideal city.There are 5 main files in this project:

1. output : This folder has all the image of out visualization and also the csv file that we got form OpenWeatherMap API.

2. api_keys.py : This python fine has our api keys stored.

3. VacationPy.ipynb: This is the Jyputer file containing the script to manupulate the data. It has focused on hotels of the city with our ideal weather.

4. WeatherPy.ipynb: This is the Jupyter file containing the scrip to manupulate the data we got from OpenWeatherMap API.
